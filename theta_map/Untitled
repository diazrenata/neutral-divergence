Theta is 2vJ, where v is the probabilty of mutation and J is the size of the system. 

However, estimating theta doesn't seem to give richness?

Note

Hubbell gives only an approximate equation for expected species number. The exact form and its variance were derived by J. Oksanen and may be unpublished.

Hubbell's model for local community is based on wrong argumentation: Hubbell assumes falsely that his model is asymptotically similar to the classical Arrhenius model. Even with that model, the argumentation in deriving ω is invalid. Moreover, ω and θ are so strongly correlated (positively) that their estimates are very unreliable.

So my thinking is to try a net of J + v and therefore theta and S. First to explore how S varies over this landscape and then to explore how the relation to the FS varies over this landscape.

For getting the size of the landscape...

- v should vary from 0-1 in some increments. Maybe .001, .1, .5, .9 to start.
- J should vary. Trivially small is important. The largest I've ever sampled successfully is 40,000 individuals; this depends somewhat on S. Maybe 50, 100, 1000, 10000, 40000?
- This giving a combination of 20 parameter combinations to try at the prospective level.

For sampling the landscape...

- First we want to compute theta for each combination of J and v.
- Then we want to compute estimated S for each theta. I think down the line this will be superceded by sampling so it doesn't have to be precise, but for scoping/heatmap purposes it's good to have the solved version.
